## SUMMARY:
I coded a dartboard using functions for a square, circle, and line. Another function was made to change the colors of the darts depending on whether they were inside or outside the circle. A function of a game between two players were made basing the winner off who had the most darts inside the circle. Also, the function called montePi approximated pi using the dartboard.
